<p>In the meantime, however, another question had become the focus of Ludwig II&apos;s political interests and had pushed the Sicilian one aside. At the beginning of the year, King Wilhelm of Holland was slain by the Frisians (Jan. 18, 1256). For the dukes of Bavaria, of course, the empire was not just finished. True to the political direction that their father had taken and strictly paused during the last years of his reign, they remained opponents of Wilhelm even after the death of Conrad IV and had never recognized his kingship 1). As if the chair in Aachen were vacant, they exercised imperial judicial powers as Count Palatine 2). Wilhelm&apos;s claims to the duchy of her ward had to keep their opposition constantly awake. In spite of this, they had not been able to think of placing the young Staufer as an opposing candidate. Now the prospective election negotiations suggested it.</p>
<p>We are inadequately informed about the initial course of this. Slowly they came into flow. If the princes had little interest in speeding them up anyway, the fact that Archbishop Gerhard von Mainz had been imprisoned by the Duke of Braunschweig since the beginning of the year had to have an inhibiting effect. Finally, an election day in Frankfurt was announced on June 23 3).</p>
<p><a href="p13"></a> If the same came about, which seems doubtful, Ludwig may have proposed his nephew&apos;s candidacy there 1). In this case, however, he hardly met with much applause. The particularistic princes could have little preference for a Hohenstaufen, especially since the money point was not his strongest side; The representatives of the imperial unity, on the other hand, like the Rhenish cities, who had decided to have a strong say in Frankfurt, demanded a protector of peace and could neither expect this quality from the four-year-old boy nor expect success from a guardian government ). In addition, at that time Ludwig was probably not on friendly terms with the Electors of Bohemia and Brandenburg, relatives of his executed wife 3).</p>
<p>With the intervention of the Pope, any prospect was soon eliminated. Whether he had heard of Hohenstaufen electoral efforts or, what is more likely, just wanted to take precautions in any case, he hurried to nip the impending danger in the bud. In a letter to the Archbishop of Mainz 4) he described in the strongest terms the perniciousness of the wicked Hobenstaufen family; The wickedness of the father is passed on to his sons; a bad tree produces only bad fruit. <a href="p14"></a> Then he emphasized the immaturity of Conradin, from whom the Church and the Reich could expect no protection, and forbade the Archbishop and his constituents, under penalty of excommunication, from giving the boy their vote or even the slightest one To provide support. Conradin&apos;s candidacy was thus stripped of the ground from the outset 1).</p>
<p>Ludwig now had to comment on the two foreign relatives of the Hohenstaufen family who applied for the German crown in the autumn of that year. It was in his own interest to secure an influential position for the future kings from the outset, which he believed he could best achieve through a family connection 2). But he also wanted to have his weighty voice paid well. For his nephew he tried to get the claims to his hereditary lands to be recognized or at least to secure him complete freedom of movement. With this in mind, he negotiated with the authorized representative of Cornwall, Johann von Avesnes, on Bacharach and F&#xFC;rstenberg in November and soon came to an agreement with him on the terms 3). Ludwig was to - not yet a year after he had his wife beheaded - enter into a new marriage with a niece of Richard 4) and the dowry was 12,000 marks, partly three <a href="p15"></a> weeks after Christmas, partly on the day of the election received, for which respected men stood up as guarantors. In return, he vowed to cast his vote for Richard and to give his bride certain goods on the Rhine as a morning gift. - Johann von Avesnes also responded to the demands that Ludwig made in favor of his nephew. Richard should renounce all treaties concluded about the Kingdom of Sicily and should not bother Konradin or his heirs in possession of it, but support him in his legal claim to the Duchy of Swabia, as well as to the other countries and allodes that would come his way 1).</p>
<p>Johann von Avesnes acted on the basis of his general em my power of attorney at its own discretion. To be fully valid, the drafts still required Richard&apos;s approval 2). Presumably, the form of the agreements that affected Konradin&apos;s claims did not satisfy them. Perhaps out of consideration for his brother, he thought he could not allow the express renunciation of the Sicilian undertaking, even though he was inwardly distant from these plans and the renunciation only applied to himself, because it was down to Heinrich III. Certainly a lot to the fact that Richard did not deprive himself of the possibility, as the German king, to lend his help to Prince Edmund, if the latter should really get serious about his Sicilian royal dignity. So Richard von Glocester and Johann von Avesnes, who were sent as certified messengers by Richard to Germany for the election of the king, began new negotiations with Ludwig, who really refrained from this demand. Twelve days after he and his brother Heinrich had cast their Palatinate and Bavarian votes in favor of the English applicant, he obtained - again in F&#xFC;rstenberg - the renewed recognition of Konradin&apos;s rights, but in a modified <a href="p16"></a> version 1) . Richard&apos;s renunciation of the Sicilian treaties no longer existed. The young Staufer was granted the title of King of Sicily and promised not to diminish him in the goods and rights that had come to him from his grandfather, father or otherwise); however, as in the previous document, there was no explicit recognition of the possession of Sicily3). On the other hand, Richard&apos;s agents now vowed that immediately after his coronation the chosen king would enfeoff the boy Konradin with the Duchy of Swabia without any delay or contradiction; he should then confirm his assurances by means of a certificate and a royal seal. Also the addition that he wanted to separate all goods of the same from those of the empire seemed to be added in favor of the Hohenstaufen, although it soon enough became evident that Richard himself against attacks, which strive to blur the boundary between household and imperial property - th, much more in need of protection than Konradin.</p>
<p>With all these promises, the Hohenstaufen interest seemed, if not brilliantly, sufficiently safeguarded. If only the execution would have followed them! But neither the marriage of Ludwig with the English princess came about, nor the fief transfer and confirmation by certificate and seal 4). <a href="p17"></a> Only the money payment will have been made on time, since otherwise the Bavarian dukes would hardly have cast their votes for Richard. If, as far as we know, Ludwig remained on friendly terms with the new king for a long time), the conclusion that stands out is that money was by far the most important object for him in the election surrender, and that he was the failure to fulfill the rest Conditions easily perverted and the Hohenstaufen interest here, where his own advantage was preserved, but probably not pursued with the usual energy. In the absence of any news about it, however, this conclusion remains uncertain; other processes unknown to us may have determined his behavior.</p>
<p>After all, his connection with Richard was also more useful for Konradin than his connection with the opposing candidate Alfonso of Castile would have been. Richard of Cornwall, leaning on Cologne and the Rhenish lands, with the support of English power, reminds in his whole position of the Guelph rulers, whose circle of interests was generally limited to the countries north of the Alps, while Alfonso, favored like King Philip once did of the Swabian giants, more in the spirit of Hohenstaufen politics directed his gaze to the south). In Italy he first tried to gain a firm foothold; this land was to become the base of his rule, and he also considered the capture of Sicily early on3). It is undisputed that among the two aspirants to the throne he was the one who, in the full development of his power, had to hurt Konradin&apos;s interests most seriously and restrict his freedom of movement the most, <a href="p18"></a> while Richard personally had little inclination to far-reaching undertakings, and his nephew&apos;s plans through the Relationship with the Pope was dangerous, but uncertain and dubious. The decisive factor had to be that Alfons, as already mentioned, laid claim to the Duchy of Swabia for himself. Through Richard&apos;s influence, Ludwig could hope to put a barrier to this endeavor.</p>
