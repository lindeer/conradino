<p>Under Frederick II, Sicily was the core of Hohenstaufen power. Preserving this land for the grandson of the great emperor had to be the next and most important concern of Ludwig. In his will, Conrad IV recommended his son to the care of the Church. To him, the circumstances that at least for the time being led to the separation of Sicily from the empire, since Konradin had not yet been elected German king, did not seem unfavorable for the attempt at reconciliation. His intention was probably that negotiations should be initiated with the Pope to take over the guardianship. The prerequisite was, of course, that he recognized the young Hohenstaufen&apos;s right to succession in Sicily.3) <a href="p6"></a> However, the Pope should not initially be granted a decisive influence on the government of the country, because the office of imperial administrator, the Bajulat , was not to him, as was his predecessor Innocent III. transferred, but to Margrave Berthold von Hohenburg, in whose place, however, after a few months Frederick II&apos;s natural son Manfred von Taranto took his place - a turn that Konradin did not seem favorable at first, because Manfred was at the head of the national opposition German rule.1)</p>
<p>Innocent, who has just transferred the Kingdom of Sicily to Edmund, the son of King Henry III. of England, had confirmed, had come closer to the Sicilian frontier on the news of Conrad IV&apos;s death. We do not know what he said about the question of guardianship. In any case, this admission could in no way satisfy his demands. Had Innocent III. the assumption of the Bajulat as his <a href="p7"></a> right 1), then it would have been the minimum of all demands for Innocent IV, if the resolutions of the Lyon church assembly had not in the meantime removed the right of inheritance of the Hohenstaufen in the eyes of the Pope altogether . Sicily was now to be wrested from their hands when the opportunity seemed to present itself; the danger of a union of this country with the Roman Empire persisted as long as a Hohenstaufen wore the crown. Should the church raise up a Frederick II again?</p>
<p>Innocent hesitated until he received news from his negotiator from England that the final conclusion of the contract had not yet taken place and that the Pope still had a free hand. In the meantime, after reaching an understanding with Konradin, Berthold von Hohenburg had entered into negotiations with the curia that led to nothing.</p>
<p>Then the change in the kingdom, which brought Manfred to the helm, and the renewed energy of the Pope, who threatened the border with an army, changed the situation.</p>
<p>In a difficult position, without firm support, Manfred was forced to enter into negotiations with Innocent, which came to an end on September 27th. The Pope showed more courtesy than ever since the Council of Lyon. He frankly recognized Konradin as King of Jerusalem and as Duke of Swabia. But on the main question of Conradin&apos;s right to the Sicilian monarchy, an understanding was only achieved because Innocent held back his true intentions and covered them up with sophistic, apparently benevolent idioms. At the request of the ambassadors he promised to uphold the other rights of Conradin, <a href="p8"></a> wherever he had them, in the kingdom of Sicily or elsewhere, and permitted all members of the kingdom to take the oath of allegiance they had to the Pope and the Roman Church would have to add the clause: &quot;Subject to the rights of the boy Conrad&quot;. 1)</p>
<p>According to the formulation of both formulas, Innocent was only absolutely bound in the event that the boy&apos;s right to Sicily was irrefutably proven to him, and that was quite impossible with the standpoint he took. This policy cannot be called honest, because he obviously knew how to arouse the faith of the ambassadors in a benevolent interpretation on his part and probably also made verbal assurances of the kind. The fact that the Sicilian plenipotentiaries allowed themselves to be fobbed off with these ambiguous phrases was a serious damage to their cause, because the Pope, received by Manfred, had hardly entered the kingdom to accept the oath of allegiance from the residents than he had with his true claims emerged more and more openly and still tried to deprive Manfred of the limited position of power that was intended for him according to the agreements, so that he finally saw in open war the only means of defense. 2)</p>
<p>Innocent was satisfied with that too. In association with the Margrave of Hohenburg and his brothers, he tried to force the annexation of the kingdom by force. - He shouldn&apos;t see the end of the year again. Be ahead At the end, however, he saw his hopes collapse, saw Manfred grow stronger and heard of his victory at Foggia (December 2, 1254). The new Pope Alexander IV did not have the boisterous temperament of his predecessor. He is described to us on all sides as a kind, gentle, god-fearing nature. 3) In the matter itself he did not step back - <a href="p9"></a> Up to now both parties had acted at their own discretion, without the consent of the relatives To be able or to want to insure the Konradins in Germany, both now sought to secure their position by authorization from this side. Above all, Manfred must have been very interested in the official recognition of his office. As long as he was not certain whether the boy was still alive - for a rumor had announced his death - he could not take any decisive steps. Towards the end of the year he received letters from long-awaited messengers informing him of the young king&apos;s well-being. 1) He probably did not hesitate much longer to explain the course of events to the Bavarian dukes and to ask them to confirm his behavior and his position.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Alexander IV also tried to establish ties with Konradin&apos;s relatives shortly after taking office. On the advice of the Margraves of Hohenburg and the Bishop of Chiemsee, he sent the latter with a letter to Agnes, the mother of the Bavarian dukes to listen, to take over Konradin&apos;s upbringing and not only to keep his rights intact, but to increase them. Despite this apparent concession, the Pope did not deviate from the Innocent IV program. It was not difficult to see that the offer he made was the recognition of Konradin as King of Jerusalem and Duke of Swabia), the assumption of education and the assurance of his friendship, yes, that he might also <a href="p10"></a> Further concessions and favors would be readily found. In return, the waiver of Sicily was probably intended. - That the Pope counted on success with certainty will appear more than doubtful. Nevertheless, the attempt can be made with serious intent. Alexander had part of the kingdom in his possession, and the letter to the Bavarian duke&apos;s widow was written in Naples. The possibility was not ruled out that the power of the papacy might intimidate the relatives of Conradin, especially since Manfred&apos;s friendship was not beyond doubt. Moreover, a few days after the dispatch of the Bishop of Chiemsee, Alexander threatened the last Staufer his Duchy of Swabia. In similar letters he called on the clerical and secular dignitaries of Swabia to support King Alfonso of Castile in his claims to his maternal inheritance and in his efforts for the Swabian duchy 1). Alfons, a grandson of King Philip of Swabia through his mother, was able to assert certain inheritance claims that had not yet been satisfied; he did not have the slightest right to the duchy 2). If Alexander ordered him to favor him at this very moment, then perhaps he was trying to put pressure on the Bavarian dukes. The more endangered the property of the Swabian duchy was, the more difficult the offered recognition and friendship of the Pope had to weigh, the sooner they could be persuaded to give their nephew the safe property in the vicinity by renouncing the unsafe property in the distance buy3).</p>
<p>It was not in contradiction to this whole policy when Alexander soon afterwards transferred the Sicilian crown to the English Prince Edmund (April 9, 1255), because Conradin&apos;s renunciation of Sicily was an unconditional prerequisite for any agreement for the Pope. Admittedly, this was dangerous because it had to arouse suspicion, and it was hopeless in any case, given the tenacious strength of Duke Ludwig. The latter might not be entirely averse to entering into negotiations with the Pope, 1 but he was unwilling to surrender Sicily. Therefore he first created a consummate fact by assigning Manfred the bajulat of the kingdom, as well as the guardianship of Conradin for Sicily, and granting him full independence of action (April 20, 1255) 2). The Bavarian Marshal Berthold von Schiltberg brought this power of attorney to Manfred, only then to go to the papal court at the same time as his envoy 3). However, after both parties had determined their opposing views on the actual subject of the dispute in advance, the negotiations that began had to be unsuccessful, of course.</p>
<p>In the meantime Manfred managed to subjugate Apulia and in the following year to become master of the whole kingdom. It was probably for the purpose of giving more weight to his negotiations with the Pope and at the same time making diplomatic relations between Ludwig and the Curia unnecessary that he had his power of attorney confirmed again in a different version with even more extensive expressions and the addition that everything in Baiern was to be regarded as valid that Manfred would agree with the Pope about Konradin&apos;s person and property inside and outside the kingdom (June 8, 1256) 4). <a href="p12"></a> This means that the direct relationship between Ludwig von Baiern and Alexander will have ceased for a while. - So things in Sicily had turned out to be more favorable than expected. For the time being there was nothing to fear from external enemies.</p>
