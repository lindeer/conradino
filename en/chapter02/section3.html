<p>Even if there were no actual advantages to be obtained here either, a prospect had opened up for Konradin of gaining a new position in Italy, a prospect which would enliven the hopes of the Staufer party and also of the shaping of conditions in Germany had to act.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are only dependent on a few incoherent documents in order to gain knowledge of Ludwig&#x2019;s policy on this side of the Alps at the same time. However different they <a href="p28"></a> may be according to their content, they all point in one and the same direction. Conradin&apos;s alliance with the Tuzzian Guelphs had already been the starting point for interference in the affairs of the empire, even if initially only for the purpose of recapturing his hereditary land of Sicily. In Germany, the small conflicts and encroachments that arose from the close amalgamation of Staufer household and imperial property gradually created a tension between Konradin and imperial authority, insofar as it was represented by Richard von Cornwall. These encroachments can first be perceived at the outermost borders of the earlier Hohenstaufen goods complex.</p>
<p>We find Konradin early on in relation to Eger 1). When he stayed in Eger with Duke Ludwig in 1259, he donated a number of nearby villages to the Waldsassen monastery, which was immediately part of the empire, and two years later, in addition to the castles of Kinsberg and Wagau, the castle in Eger, which was once built by Friedrich Barbarossa, even succeeded. and the ruins of which can still look down into the lovely Egerthal today, to win a promise of money from the bailiffs of Weida, Plauen and Gera and to make them serve the Hohenstaufen interests themselves 2). The citizens of the imperial city of Eger also had the duke, as the guardian of Konradin, grant or confirm fiefs 3).</p>
<p>In the spring of 1260, Ludwig made an attempt to regain influence for his nephew in the far west, in Alsace, which had quickly alienated itself from the Staufers. There the barons of Lichtenberg took a competitive position with the family of those of W&#xF6;rth, who had been in possession of the landgrave dignity for the Lower Alsace for a long time <a href="p29"></a>. In order to dispute this with them, Ludwig von Lichtenberg, the Vogt of Strasbourg, turned to the last Staufer, who really refused him with the Landgraviate in Alsace 1). He had neither the right to do this, because the landgraviate was dependent on the empire, nor did he have the power to enforce the illegal move. That he, or rather Ludwig II. Had no intention of standing up for the new life man, proves the addition that Herr von Lichtenberg must seize his office at his own risk and expense and without harming Konradin in any way 2).</p>
<p>So was it just a frivolous game that was started in the hope of winning without a stake? - Certainly the uncertainty that often prevailed with regard to the boundary between household and imperial property, between ducal and royal competences also played a role in all such processes. With the long union of imperial dignity with that of a Duke of Swabia in the Hohenstaufen dynasty, with the same administration of private and imperial property, a close connection between the two components had arisen through custom, and custom was closely related to law in the Middle Ages. Now the connection should suddenly be released again. It is not surprising that there were vacillations in some property and competence questions, and if on the one hand a strong hand was missing to preserve the goods and powers of the empire, on the other hand the temptation was all the stronger to serve one&apos;s own advantage halfway with the awareness of the law and tradition.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, such an approach would make King Richard&apos;s relationship with Konradin unfavorable. If he had undertaken to separate the imperial goods from the Hohenstaufen <a href="p30"></a> goods, this sentence also applied in the same way to the Hohenstaufen. Just as the German king had not kept his promise of immediate enfeoffment with Swabians, so Konradin was now violating those agreements in a different direction. We have not yet received any specific information about Richard&apos;s dissatisfaction with the Stau- fian party during his short stay on the Rhine in 1260, but it can already be deduced from individual symptoms for this period. When in Worms he ordered the Florentine ambassador Beroardi not to travel further to Konradin, it was certainly not in the interests of the latter. Richard tried to thwart a connection between the Staufer and Italy. - At the same time he came into closer contact with Ulrich von W&#xFC;rtemberg, one of the most powerful Swabian counts. This, the actual founder of the W&#xFC;rttemberg power, had previously been a zealous enemy of the Hohenstaufen 2). After the death of Wilhelm of Holland, however, he did not support Alfonso of Castile, but sought mediation between Richard and the Staufer party 3). In this intermediate position he was apparently quite well, because he was given rich donations from both sides, as his support was valued very highly. Soon after Richard&apos;s first departure to England he was enfeoffed by Konradin with the office of marshal in the whole of the Duchy of Swabia, with the royal bailiwick of the old imperial palace of Ulm 4) and the neck court of Piersse nearby 5). It now seems that after his return in the following year Richard - at that time already in tension with Konradin - wanted to outbid the favor - <a href="p31"></a> demonstrations of the same. In Worms he promised the Count of W&#xFC;rtemberg that he would have made his wishes comfortable), a sum of money, confirmed to him the imperial fiefs transferred to him by the opposing Staufer kings, Richard&apos;s ancestors, and again gave him the fiefs that were granted by the Death of the Count of Urach had fallen back to the Empire?). Thus, Ulrich&apos;s wisely calculated vacillation between two applicants increased the W&#xFC;rttemberg property.</p>
