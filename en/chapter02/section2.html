<p>In Italy, through Manfred&apos;s deed, all conditions had been completely reversed. It was significant right from the start that the messengers that Ludwig sent to Italy to refute the rumor of his nephew&apos;s death went straight to the papal court in Anagni and there convinced the Pope and the cardinals by showing a document that that Konradin was still alive5). Manfred could no longer represent his nephew&apos;s interests at the Curia, as he was instructed to do two years ago. Direct negotiations began anew between the Pope and the Bavarian Duke. The more brilliant Manfred&apos;s situation within his kingdom became, the further he reached beyond this area by establishing connections with the Ghibellines of central Italy and placing the Pope in an increasingly unfortunate position, the closer it had to be for him to be came back to his earlier idea of &#x200B;&#x200B;playing off the Hohenstaufen pretender against the overpowering Manfred. We do not know what proposals the Bishop of Veroli made to Duke Ludwig <a href="p24"></a> when he was sent by the Pope to negotiate at the Bavarian court 1). Probably they did not contain the recognition of the Sicilian royal dignity, and because of this this attempt will ultimately have failed again 2). After all, because of Manfred&apos;s hostility to Konradin, things were much more favorable for Alexander this time, and relations were not broken off for the time being.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1260 two ambassadors from Ludwig Konrad Kroff von Fl&#xFC;glingen and Konrad Bussarus stayed at the curia and negotiated about Konradin&apos;s affair 3). During their stay in Italy they may have gained the insight that from the central Italian Ghibellines, who at that time had entered into closer contact with Manfred and received support from him, little was to be expected for Konradin at the moment, that on the other hand the Guelphs, who anxiously looked around for outside help to ward off the impending danger, could be won over to anyone who promised them it. So they got involved all too independently in a connection with the Florentine Guelphs, indeed they abused their inviolable position as ambassadors to the extent that they wanted to take part in the struggle of the Florentines against the Sienese supported by Manfred and to help them with armed men hurried 4). On the way, however, they were attacked in the church area 5) by Raulo, <a href="p25"></a> a Roman nobleman who had fallen into prodigality and who had promised them his help, and other accomplices. Bussarus was killed, the other envoy got away with a wound and went to Florence. The rumor described Manfred as the instigator of the deed 1). The negotiations between Ludwig and the Pope were severely disturbed by this incident and, as far as we know, did not proceed any further 2).</p>
<p>In the meantime there was another starting point for interference in Italy. The Florentine Guelphs, who were in ever greater danger, had already unsuccessfully tried to establish ties with Alfonso of Castile and Richard of Cornwall. Her envoy Wilhelm Beroardi negotiated with the latter in the late summer of the year at Worms 3). He was instructed to travel on from there to Bavaria and to visit Konradin, but hesitated on the orders of King Richard and in the absence of a suitable guide until the horror - <a href="p26"></a> news overtook him that his people were with him in battle Montaperti had been beaten by the enemy and was close to annihilation. Believing that all was now lost, he returned to Italy without completing his mission. After that terrible defeat, the Florentine Guelphs had actually evacuated their hometown and left it to the Ghibellines who had hitherto been driven out of it. But they themselves had found refuge in the friendly Lucca, and while around them almost all the central Italian cities passed over to the Ghibellines, they looked for each other - less trusting in the support of the Pope than in the hope of foreigners Help to assert against the superior force.</p>
<p>In this situation they tried to get in touch with Konradin again around March 1261 and sent their envoy and Syndic Oddo Altoviti to him - a peculiar constellation that Guelphs, who were favored by the Pope, meet here turned to the heirs of the Hohenstaufen house for protection! After a detailed but colorful description of the latest events and their own prospects, they expressed the ardent wish that Konradin would come to Italy; by his mere appearance he would drive his enemies to flight, recapture his kingdom. They, who would soon regain the upper hand over their enemies, made their power available to him 1). In a document that the envoy took with him in addition to this letter, it seems, the conditions and mutual obligations of a protective and defensive alliance with Konradin, for which they longed for, were drawn up 2).</p>
<p>As tempting as this request sounded, the youth of Konradin still hindered an energetic approach in this direction.</p>
<p>After all, Duke Ludwig did not want to deny the opportunity to interfere in Italian conditions, which could be of great importance for the future <a href="p27"></a>. Konradin himself received the ambassador, listened to him, and released him with a letter in which he actually accepted the suggestion and in which he or his authorized representative promised to expedite his arrival in Italy as soon as possible. He was free to dispose of the point in time, claiming that he must first seek advice from the German princes and then make precise inquiries about the route of the march. He explicitly declared the Guelphs for his party, their enemies for his enemies, assured them of his protection and, if they demanded it, also held out the prospect of attacking their opponents. He had the contract document of the Florentines deposited in his archives and their promises - especially if they were directed against Manfred - confirmed by an oath which their envoy took on behalf of the whole party 1).</p>
<p>The newly established relations continued for some time, because in the following year another embassy was sent from the Florentine Guelphs, this time together with the Lucchese, to Konradin. She probably returned without having received a more definite promise than the first time.</p>
<p>There is no news of any further negotiations 2).</p>
